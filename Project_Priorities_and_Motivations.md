# 🔥 Project Priorities and Motivations – Ticket AI Classifier

## Motivations
- 🧠 Human error in classification is common and costly
- ⏱️ Manual tagging and replying takes too long
- 🎯 Need for consistent outputs that align with internal SOPs

## Core Priorities
1. **Accuracy First**  
   - No assumptions or guesses
   - Validate dealer info using mapping file only

2. **Speed Without Compromise**  
   - Process and respond in < 5 seconds once files are loaded

3. **Zoho-Compliant Formatting**  
   - Replies must use exact templates (no em dashes, no contractions)

4. **Debuggable and Auditable**  
   - Every response must be traceable to loaded file content

5. **Lightweight, Slot-Safe**  
   - Minimal memory usage, no feed file caching

## Why This Matters
- This classifier will power the bulk of Zoho ticket handling
- Accuracy protects reputation and prevents miscommunication
- It’s the first step toward a fully autonomous support triage system
