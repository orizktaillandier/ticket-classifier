## üß† Reasoning Logic
- Always infer intent from full message
- Use clues from contact name, syndicator keyword, and product terms
- If image issue: check if it is overwrite vs delay
- If asking to stop feed: use Product Cancellation
- If activating new feed: use Product Activation ‚Äì Existing Client
- If asking a question about pricing or import logic: use General Question
